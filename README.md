# StarzPlay Code Challenge

This project started as a coding challenge for StarzPlay, where I aimed to showcase my skills in clean and testable code. The initial implementation included the following features:

1. **User Interface Design**: Developed a responsive and intuitive UI using SwiftUI.
2. **API Integration**: Created API calls using my custom API library, Firework.
3. **Basic Video Player**: Designed and implemented a simple video player.
4. **Unit Testing**: Followed Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure robust and reliable code.

## Expanding the Project

After completing the initial challenge, I decided to take this assignment further by exploring new features and improvements in SwiftUI. This project has become a sandbox for me to experiment with:

- **SwiftUI Enhancements**: Incorporating the latest updates and best practices in SwiftUI.
- **tvOS Support**: Expanding the project to support tvOS, aiming to create a seamless experience across platforms.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly updating and refining the codebase to polish my skills and stay current with new technologies.

This repository is now more than just a challenge; it's a continuous learning journey, allowing me to push the boundaries of what's possible with SwiftUI and beyond.
